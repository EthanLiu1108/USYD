## Meet Karel the Robot⭐ 

[Karel the Robot](https://compedu.stanford.edu/karel-reader/docs/python/en/intro.html):In the 1970s, a Stanford graduate student named Rich Pattis decided that it would be easier to teach the fundamentals of programming if students could somehow learn the basic ideas in a simple environment free from the complexities that characterize most programming languages. Rich designed an introductory programming environment in which students teach a robot to solve simple problems. That robot was named Karel, after the Czech playwright Karel Čapek, whose 1923 play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots) gave the word robot to the English language. 

Karel the Robot was quite a success. Karel has been used in introductory computer science courses all across the world and has been taught to millions of students. Many generations of Stanford students learned how programming works with Karel, and it is still the gentle introduction to coding used at Stanford.
